    <h1> Day of the Week </h1>
    <p>Given any date, you can figure out the day of the week on that specific day with the following steps.</p>
    <h2> General Solution</h2>
    <p> Follow these instructions:<br></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Remember or note down these two codes:<br>January = 6<br>February = 2<br>March = 2<br>April = 5<br>May =
        0<br>June = 3<br>July = 5<br>August = 1<br>September = 4<br>October = 6<br>November = 2<br>December = 4
        <br><br><strong>Beware!</strong>
        <br>For leap years, the code for January will become 5 and the one for<br> February will be 1.

        <br><br>
        <img src="YearCodes.png" alt="Year codes. Images are on strike, try again another time!" width="500" />
        <p>However, the good news is that we do not have to remember all these<br> codes. The trick is to know what
          years have 0 codes, for <br>example, 2006. Then, for every year after 2006, your code increases<br> by 1 -
          2007
          has a 0 + 1 = 1 code. However, if you come <br>across a leap year, such as 2008, you have to add two.
          Therefore, <br>2008 has a 1 + 2 = 3 code (2007’s code + 2). This cycle continues <br>on, until you reach 6 or
          5. If
          the next year isn’t a leap year, a six code<br> from the previous year would become a 0 code, while a 5 code
          <br>would become a 0 code if it was a leap year. Essentially, 7 codes are <br>instead 0 codes.
        </p>
        <strong>Trick</strong><br>Years from 2000 to 2009 (Let the year be 2000 + x):<br>
        Year code = x/4 (discard the remainder) + x<br>
        Finally, subtract the largest multiple of 7 from your current year code.<br>
        <strong>Example</strong><br>
        For the year 2065, we have x as 65. x/4 = 65/4 = 16 R 1 (We forget the 1, or the remainder) <br>Year code = 16 +
        65 = 81<br>
        Largest multiple: 77<br>
        Therefore, the year code for 2065 is 81-77 = 4
      </li>
      <li>Add the date (1-31), month codes, and year codes together, then subtract the largest multiple of 7 from this
        sum.<br>
        Eg. March 19, 2061<br>
        19 + 2 + 6 = 27<br>
        27-21 = 6, or Saturday.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2> January 1</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remember this code:<br>Monday = 1<br>Tuesday = 2<br>Wednesday = 3<br>Thursday = 4<br>Friday = 5<br>Saturday =
        6<br>Sunday = 7 or 0
      </li>
      <li>Take the last two digits of the year and multiply it by 25%, or ¼. Next, discard the change, and add the
        original amount. <br> <strong>Example</strong><br>In year 2067, we take these steps:<br>
        67 * 25% = 67 * ¼ = 16.75<br>Discarding the change, we have 16.<br>Adding the original amount, 67, we have:
        67+16 = 83<br>We subtract the largest multiple of 7, 77 from 83 to calculate: 83-77 = 6, or Saturday!</li>
    </ol>
