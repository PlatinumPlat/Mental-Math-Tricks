      <h1> Day of the Week </h1>
      <p>Given any date, you can figure out the day of the week on that specific day with the following steps.</p>
      <h2> General Solution</h2>
      <p> Follow these instructions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Remember or note down these two codes: <br>
          <img src="Images/MonthCodes.png" class = "chart" id="vertical" alt="Month codes. Images are on strike, try again another time!" />
          <img src="Images/YearCodes.png" class = "chart" id = "vertical" alt="Year codes. Images are on strike, try again another time!" />
          <br>
          <div class = "warning"><strong>Beware!</strong>
            (Left Chart) For leap years, the code for January will become 5 and the one for February will be 1.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>However, the good news is that we do not have to remember all these codes. The trick is to know what
            years have 0 codes, for example, 2006. Then, for every year after 2006, your code increases by 1 -
            2007
            has a 0 + 1 = 1 code. However, if you come across a leap year, such as 2008, you have to add two.
            Therefore, 2008 has a 1 + 2 = 3 code (2007 code + 2). This cycle continues on, until you reach 6
            or
            5. If
            the next year is not a leap year, a six code from the previous year would become a 0 code, while a 5 code
            would become a 0 code if it was a leap year. Essentially, 7 codes are instead 0 codes.
          </p>
          <strong>Trick</strong><br>Years from 2000 to 2009 (Let the year be 2000 + x):<br>
          Year code = x/4 (discard the remainder) + x<br>
          Finally, subtract the largest multiple of 7 from your current year code.<br>
          <strong>Example</strong><br>
          For the year 2065, we have x as 65. x/4 = 65/4 = 16 R 1 (We forget the 1, or the remainder) <br> Year code =
          16
          +
          65 = 81<br>
          Largest multiple: 77<br>
          Therefore, the year code for 2065 is 81-77 = 4
        </li>
        <li>Add the date (1-31), month codes, and year codes together, then subtract the largest multiple of 7 from this
          sum.<br>
          Eg. March 19, 2061<br>
          19 + 2 + 6 = 27<br>
          27-21 = 6, or Saturday.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2> January 1</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Remember this code:<br>
          <img src="Images/WeekCodes.png" class = "chart" id="small" alt="Week codes. Images are on strike, try again another time!" />
        </li>
        <li>Take the last two digits of the year and multiply it by 25%, or ¼. Next, discard the change, and add the
          original amount.<br>
          <strong>Example</strong>
          <br>In year 2067, we take these steps:<br>
          67 * 25% = 67 * ¼ = 16.75 <br> Discarding the change, we have 16. Adding the original amount, 67, we have:<br>
          67+16 = 83 <br> We subtract the largest multiple of 7, 77 from 83 to calculate: <br>83-77 = 6, or Saturday!
        </li>
      </ol>
